Scenario 1 : University student
"I have some problems understanding some of the things that the professor says, and sometimes I can't hear well what he says due to the huge lecture room we're in and the sound quality
And the number of students present. And due to the long duration of the lecture my attention weavers with time especially after hitting the 45 minutes mark. I find it a lot easier to learn from the assistant teacher ; that's probably because he works in a much smaller room and with few people present.
So I actually feel like the assistant is talking directly to me rather than feeling no connection with large number of people present. I wish the professor was to teach me in private with a small group like the assistant teacher "

/* create an environment where the student feels like the professor is giving him all the attention and make sure to have a clear audio and video quality, videos are organized and small , never go longer than 45 minutes */

scenario 2: professor
" as a professor sometimes I have to teach things that I'm not particularly fond of. The duration of the term also limits the amount of material I'd teach
  So sometimes I feel like I didn't give the students all the information I have about the course. It'd be nice if I could teach all the things I know about the things I love which will be useful to passionate learners
  Rather than learners how feel like they're obligated to be here and have no passion at all."

/* create an environment where the professor can teach what he likes and have students who care. */
